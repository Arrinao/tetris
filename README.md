# tetris

This is an attempt to recreate the good old Brick Game console in Python.

The program right now only features the game Tetris. It will feature more games in the future.

There is a High Scores list avaliable to access from the menu on the right side, that displays the best achievements in the games.

The game itself is controllable with a keyboard. Pressing P will pause the game; arrow keys will move the blocks around. The Up arrow key in tetris serves as the rotate button.

**Installation info**
All the font files (.ttf) need to be moved into the Fonts folder. On windows the directory is C:\Windows\Fonts.
